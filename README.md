# GiantsEdit source code

## About

This is the source code of GiantsEdit (version 5.43) - an unofficial level editor for Giants: Citizen Kabuto that I wrote around the year 2002 in Delphi.

I'm releasing it as there's surprisingly still interest in Giants 20 years after its release.

## Code

Code style and naming conventions are not up to standards as I was still learning and this was my by far largest project back then.

As usual for Delphi there are source files (.pas for Pascal) and dialog form files (.dfm) - some of the latter are readable, some aren't.

## Compiling

This is old and untested code; I can't make guarantees about whether it still works.

You need both Delphi 6 and the ZipMaster package. It should work with Delphi 7 as well because Delphi 6 and 7 are quite similar.

## License

The code is licensed under GPL v2 or later for now. Let me know if you think that you need a different license.
